# 🚀 Rocket Journey: Earth to Mars

A graphical simulation of a rocket leaving Earth and landing on Mars, built using **graphics.h** in C.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

The project utilized the following tools and technologies:

1. **graphics.h Library**  
   Enabled the creation of graphical elements and animations in C.

2. **C Programming Language**  
   Primary language used for implementing project logic and features.

3. **Turbo C++ Compiler**  
   Provided the environment for coding and compiling the project.

4. **Random Number Generator**  
   Used to generate random coordinates for dynamic visual effects such as stars in the background.

5. **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**  
   IDEs like Turbo C++ or Dev-C++ were used for writing, compiling, and debugging efficiently.

6. **Version Control System (GitHub)**  
   Managed changes to the codebase, facilitated collaboration, and tracked project iterations.

## 📌 Notes

This project demonstrates basic graphics programming in C, simulating a rocket’s journey from Earth to Mars with animations and dynamic effects.

## PS:
Was lazy to write readme so used generated it.
