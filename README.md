A graphics of rocket leaving earth and landing to mars.

Tools and Technologies used
 The project utilized the following tools and technologies:
1.	graphics.h Library: This library, available in C programming, enabled the creation of graphical elements and animations.
2.	C Programming Language: The primary programming language used for development, providing the necessary functionalities for implementing the project's logic and features.
3.	Turbo C++ Compiler: Specifically, the Turbo C++ compiler environment was employed for development, providing a platform for coding and compiling the project.
4.	Random Number Generator: Utilized for generating random coordinates to create dynamic visual effects such as stars in the background.
5.	IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Although not explicitly mentioned, an IDE like Turbo C++, Dev-C++ would have been used for writing, compiling, and debugging the code efficiently.
6.	Version Control System (GitHub): GitHub may have been utilized as a version control system to manage changes to codebase, facilitating collaboration between team members and enabling the tracking of project iterations.
